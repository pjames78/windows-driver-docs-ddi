## -description

*Dxgkrnl* calls ***D3DKMTOpenNativeFenceFromNTHandle** to open an existing shared native fence on a different device or process.

## -parameters

### -param unnamedParam1

[in/out] Pointer to a [**D3DKMT_OPENNATIVEFENCEFROMNTHANDLE**](ns-d3dkmthk-d3dkmt_opennativefencefromnthandle.md) structure that describes the fence object to open.

## -returns

**D3DKMTOpenNativeFenceFromNTHandle** returns STATUS_SUCCESS on successful creation. Otherwise it returns an NTSTATUS error code such as STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.

## -remarks

If the native fence is being opened on a different device of the same process, then [**NativeFenceMapping**](ns-d3dkmthk-d3dkmt_opennativefencefromnthandle.md) contains the same virtual addresses as the original native fence. If it is being opened on a different process, then **NativeFenceMapping** contains new VAs mapped in the new process address space.
